## 🛢 About CSV To SQL Connection
CSV files are a simple and widely used format for raw data, but they become limiting as datasets grow and queries get more complex. Moving CSV data into SQL databases provides structure, scalability, and efficiency, allowing faster lookups, relational joins, and more advanced analytics.

The process typically starts by creating a database and defining tables that mirror the structure of the CSV file. Using Python libraries like pandas for reading the CSV and database connectors for establishing the connection (with credentials such as user, password, host, and database name), the data is then inserted into the SQL tables. Once set up, the database becomes the backbone for queries, automation, and integration with dashboards or applications, replacing flat-file limitations with a more reliable and dynamic system.
